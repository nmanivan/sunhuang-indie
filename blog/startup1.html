            <article class="blog-post-content">
                <p>It all started when I parted ways with an unfulfilling job. The decision wasn't dramatic or impulsive—it was more like a quiet realization that I needed something different. Something that aligned with who I was becoming rather than who I was expected to be.</p>

                <p>What followed was a period of exploration. I dove into my passions: playing basketball, volleyball, taking classes on Coursera, learning new skills, and just tinkering with ideas. There was something liberating about having the time and space to explore without the pressure of a traditional career path. I wasn't sure where I was heading, but I knew I was moving in the right direction.</p>

                <p>Then, my friend asked me if I wanted to join his startup for a few months. I jumped at the chance. Working there gave me a front-row seat to the startup world—the hustle, the problem-solving, the constant iteration. It was exciting, but more importantly, it was clarifying. After those few months, I realized I didn't just want to work at a startup—I wanted to build my own product in a space I was genuinely passionate about.</p>

                <h2>The Basketball Training App</h2>

                <p>My first attempt was a basketball training app. Basketball had always been a passion of mine, and I thought I understood the space well enough to build something meaningful. I started working on it, learning as I went, building features I thought would help players improve their game. It was my first real taste of product development, and while it didn't become the breakout success I'd imagined, it taught me invaluable lessons about building, iterating, and staying true to a vision.</p>

                <h2>Working with a Co-Founder</h2>

                <p>Next, I worked with a co-founder on an exercise form analyzer. This was a different experience entirely—collaborating, sharing ideas, building something together. The exercise form analyzer was more technical, more focused, and it pushed me to think about problems differently. Working with someone else forced me to articulate my ideas more clearly and consider perspectives I might have missed on my own.</p>

                <h2>Reform: The Current Chapter</h2>

                <p>Now, I'm working on <strong>Reform</strong>—a free personal coach for all kinds of exercises. This time, I'm building it with 2 hometown friends, and there's something special about working with people you've known for years. We're bringing together our different strengths, our shared passion for fitness, and our collective vision of making exercise guidance accessible to everyone.</p>

                <p>Reform represents everything I've learned so far: the importance of solving real problems, the value of collaboration, and the power of building something you're genuinely excited about. It's still early days, but I'm more confident in this direction than I've been in any previous attempt.</p>

                <h2>What I've Learned</h2>

                <p>This journey has taught me that building products isn't just about the code or the features—it's about understanding problems, connecting with people, and staying true to what you're passionate about. Each project has been a stepping stone, teaching me something new about product development, collaboration, and myself.</p>

                <p>I've also learned that the best projects come from genuine passion. Whether it's basketball, exercise form, or now Reform, the work feels different when you're building something you'd use yourself, something that solves a problem you've experienced firsthand.</p>

                <h2>Looking Forward</h2>

                <p>I'm excited about Reform and where it's heading. Working with hometown friends brings a different energy—we understand each other, we trust each other, and we're all committed to building something great. The goal is to make exercise guidance accessible and free, helping people improve their form and stay healthy.</p>

                <p>If you're on a similar journey, or if you want to learn more about Reform, I'd love to connect. Building products is a journey, and it's always better when we can share what we're learning along the way.</p>

                <p>Here's to building things that matter, with people who matter.</p>
